## Upgrading To 5.0 From 4.2

### Fresh Install, Then Migrate

The recommended method of upgrading is to create a new Laravel `5.0` install and then to copy your `4.2` site's unique application files into the new application. This would include controllers, routes, Eloquent models, Artisan commands, assets, and other code specific to your application.

To start, [install a new Laravel 5 application](/docs/5.0/installation) into a fresh directory in your local environment. We'll discuss each piece of the migration process in further detail below.

### Composer Dependencies & Packages

Don't forget to copy any additional Composer dependencies into your 5.0 application. This includes third-party code such as SDKs.

Some Laravel-specific packages may not be compatible with Laravel 5 on initial release. Check with your package's maintainer to determine the proper version of the package for Laravel 5. Once you have added any additional Composer dependencies your application needs, run `composer update`.

### Namespacing

By default, Laravel 4 applications did not utilize namespacing within your application code. So, for example, all Eloquent models and controllers simply lived in the "global" namespace. For a quicker migration, you can simply leave these classes in the global namespace in Laravel 5 as well.

### Configuration

#### Migrating Environment Variables

Copy the new `.env.example` file to `.env`, which is the `5.0` equivalent of the old `.env.php` file. Set any appropriate values there, like your `APP_ENV` and `APP_KEY` (your encryption key), your database credentials, and your cache and session drivers.

Additionally, copy any custom values you had in your old `.env.php` file and place them in both `.env` (the real value for your local environment) and `.env.example` (a sample instructional value for other team members).

For more information on environment configuration, view the [full documentation](/docs/5.0/configuration#environment-configuration).

> **Note:** You will need to place the appropriate `.env` file and values on your production server before deploying your Laravel 5 application.

#### Configuration Files

Laravel 5.0 no longer uses `app/config/{environmentName}/` directories to provide specific configuration files for a given environment. Instead, move any configuration values that vary by environment into `.env`, and then access them in your configuration files using `env('key', 'default value')`. You will see examples of this in the `config/database.php` configuration file.

Set the config files in the `config/` directory to represent either the values that are consistent across all of your environments, or set them to use `env()` to load values that vary by environment.

Remember, if you add more keys to `.env` file, add sample values to the `.env.example` file as well. This will help your other team members create their own `.env` files.

### Routes

Copy and paste your old `routes.php` file into your new `app/Http/routes.php`.

### Controllers

Next, move all of your controllers into the `app/Http/Controllers` directory. Since we are not going to migrate to full namespacing in this guide, add the `app/Http/Controllers` directory to the `classmap` directive of your `composer.json` file. Next, you can remove the namespace from the abstract `app/Http/Controllers/Controller.php` base class. Verify that your migrated controllers are extending this base class.

In your `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php` file, set the `namespace` property to `null`.

### Route Filters

Copy your filter bindings from `app/filters.php` and place them into the `boot()` method of `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php`. Add `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;` in the `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php` in order to continue using the `Route` Facade.

You do not need to move over any of the default Laravel 4.0 filters such as `auth` and `csrf`; they're all here, but as middleware. Edit any routes or controllers that reference the old default filters (e.g. `['before' => 'auth']`) and change them to reference the new middleware (e.g. `['middleware' => 'auth'].`)

Filters are not removed in Laravel 5. You can still bind and use your own custom filters using `before` and `after`.

### Global CSRF

By default, [CSRF protection](/docs/5.0/routing#csrf-protection) is enabled on all routes. If you'd like to disable this, or only manually enable it on certain routes, remove this line from `App\Http\Kernel`'s `middleware` array:

	'App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken',

If you want to use it elsewhere, add this line to `$routeMiddleware`:

	'csrf' => 'App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken',

Now you can add the middleware to individual routes / controllers using `['middleware' => 'csrf']` on the route. For more information on middleware, consult the [full documentation](/docs/5.0/middleware).

### Eloquent Models

Feel free to create a new `app/Models` directory to house your Eloquent models. Again, add this directory to the `classmap` directive of your `composer.json` file.

Update any models using `SoftDeletingTrait` to use `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes`.

#### Eloquent Caching

Eloquent no longer provides the `remember` method for caching queries. You now are responsible for caching your queries manually using the `Cache::remember` function. For more information on caching, consult the [full documentation](/docs/5.0/cache).

### User Authentication Model

To upgrade your `User` model for Laravel 5's authentication system, follow these instructions:

**Delete the following from your `use` block:**

```php
use Illuminate\Auth\UserInterface;
use Illuminate\Auth\Reminders\RemindableInterface;
```

**Add the following to your `use` block:**

```php
use Illuminate\Auth\Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Auth\Passwords\CanResetPassword;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable as AuthenticatableContract;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\CanResetPassword as CanResetPasswordContract;
```

**Remove the UserInterface and RemindableInterface interfaces.**

**Mark the class as implementing the following interfaces:**

```php
implements AuthenticatableContract, CanResetPasswordContract
```

**Include the following traits within the class declaration:**

```php
use Authenticatable, CanResetPassword;
```

### Cashier User Changes

The name of the trait and interface used by [Laravel Cashier](/docs/5.0/billing) has changed. Instead of using `BillableTrait`, use the `Laravel\Cashier\Billable` trait. And, instead of `Larave\Cashier\BillableInterface` implement the `Laravel\Cashier\Contracts\Billable` interface instead. No other method changes are required.

### Artisan Commands

Move all of your command classes from your old `app/commands` directory to the new `app/Console/Commands` directory. Next, add the `app/Console/Commands` directory to the `classmap` directive of your `composer.json` file.

Then, copy your list of Artisan commands from `start/artisan.php` into the `command` array of the `app/Console/Kernel.php` file.

### Database Migrations & Seeds

Delete the two migrations included with Laravel 5.0, since you should already have the users table in your database.

Move all of your migration classes from the old `app/database/migrations` directory to the new `database/migrations`. All of your seeds should be moved from `app/database/seeds` to `database/seeds`.

### Global IoC Bindings

If you have any [IoC](/docs/5.0/container) bindings in `start/global.php`, move them all to the `register` method of the `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` file. You may need to import the `App` facade.

Optionally, you may break these bindings up into separate service providers by category.

### Views

Move your views from `app/views` to the new `resources/views` directory.

### Blade Tag Changes

For better security by default, Laravel 5.0 escapes all output from both the `{{ }}` and `{{{ }}}` Blade directives. A new `{!! !!}` directive has been introduced to display raw, unescaped output. The most secure option when upgrading your application is to only use the new `{!! !!}` directive when you are **certain** that it is safe to display raw output.

However, if you **must** use the old Blade syntax, add the following lines at the bottom of `AppServiceProvider@register`:

```php
\Blade::setRawTags('{{', '}}');
\Blade::setContentTags('{{{', '}}}');
\Blade::setEscapedContentTags('{{{', '}}}');
```

This should not be done lightly, and may make your application more vulnerable to XSS exploits. Also, comments with `{{--` will no longer work.

### Translation Files

Move your language files from `app/lang` to the new `resources/lang` directory.

### Public Directory

Copy your application's public assets from your `4.2` application's `public` directory to your new application's `public` directory. Be sure to keep the `5.0` version of `index.php`.

### Tests

Move your tests from `app/tests` to the new `tests` directory.

### Misc. Files

Copy in any other files in your project. For example, `.scrutinizer.yml`, `bower.json` and other similar tooling configuration files.

You may move your Sass, Less, or CoffeeScript to any location you wish. The `resources/assets` directory could be a good default location.

### Form & HTML Helpers

If you're using Form or HTML helpers, you will see an error stating `class 'Form' not found` or `class 'Html' not found`. To fix this, add `"illuminate/html": "~5.0"` to your `composer.json` file's `require` section.

You'll also need to add the Form and HTML facades and service provider. Edit `config/app.php`, and add this line to the 'providers' array:

    'Illuminate\Html\HtmlServiceProvider',

Next, add these lines to the 'aliases' array:

    'Form'      => 'Illuminate\Html\FormFacade',
    'Html'      => 'Illuminate\Html\HtmlFacade',

### CacheManager

If your application code was injecting `Illuminate\Cache\CacheManager` to get a non-Facade version of Laravel's cache, inject `Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Repository` instead.

### Pagination

Replace any calls to `$paginator->links()` with `$paginator->render()`.

### Beanstalk Queuing

Laravel 5.0 now requires `"pda/pheanstalk": "~3.0"` instead of `"pda/pheanstalk": "~2.1"`.

### Remote

The Remote component has been deprecated.

### Workbench

The Workbench component has been deprecated.

<a name="upgrade-4.2"></a>
## Upgrading To 4.2 From 4.1

### PHP 5.4+

Laravel 4.2 requires PHP 5.4.0 or greater.

### Encryption Defaults

Add a new `cipher` option in your `app/config/app.php` configuration file. The value of this option should be `MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256`.

	'cipher' => MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256

This setting may be used to control the default cipher used by the Laravel encryption facilities.

> **Note:** In Laravel 4.2, the default cipher is `MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128` (AES), which is considered to be the most secure cipher. Changing the cipher back to `MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256` is required to decrypt cookies/values that were encrypted in Laravel <= 4.1

### Soft Deleting Models Now Use Traits

If you are using soft deleting models, the `softDeletes` property has been removed. You must now use the `SoftDeletingTrait` like so:

	use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingTrait;

	class User extends Eloquent {
		use SoftDeletingTrait;
	}

You must also manually add the `deleted_at` column to your `dates` property:

	class User extends Eloquent {
		use SoftDeletingTrait;

		protected $dates = ['deleted_at'];
	}

The API for all soft delete operations remains the same.

> **Note:** The `SoftDeletingTrait` can not be applied on a base model. It must be used on an actual model class.

### View / Pagination Environment Renamed

If you are directly referencing the `Illuminate\View\Environment` class or `Illuminate\Pagination\Environment` class, update your code to reference `Illuminate\View\Factory` and `Illuminate\Pagination\Factory` instead. These two classes have been renamed to better reflect their function.

### Additional Parameter On Pagination Presenter

If you are extending the `Illuminate\Pagination\Presenter` class, the abstract method `getPageLinkWrapper` signature has changed to add the `rel` argument:

	abstract public function getPageLinkWrapper($url, $page, $rel = null);

### Iron.Io Queue Encryption

If you are using the Iron.io queue driver, you will need to add a new `encrypt` option to your queue configuration file:

    'encrypt' => true

<a name="upgrade-4.1.29"></a>
## Upgrading To 4.1.29 From <= 4.1.x

Laravel 4.1.29 improves the column quoting for all database drivers. This protects your application from some mass assignment vulnerabilities when **not** using the `fillable` property on models. If you are using the `fillable` property on your models to protect against mass assignment, your application is not vulnerable. However, if you are using `guarded` and are passing a user controlled array into an "update" or "save" type function, you should upgrade to `4.1.29` immediately as your application may be at risk of mass assignment.

To upgrade to Laravel 4.1.29, simply `composer update`. No breaking changes are introduced in this release.

<a name="upgrade-4.1.26"></a>
## Upgrading To 4.1.26 From <= 4.1.25

Laravel 4.1.26 introduces security improvements for "remember me" cookies. Before this update, if a remember cookie was hijacked by another malicious user, the cookie would remain valid for a long period of time, even after the true owner of the account reset their password, logged out, etc.

This change requires the addition of a new `remember_token` column to your `users` (or equivalent) database table. After this change, a fresh token will be assigned to the user each time they login to your application. The token will also be refreshed when the user logs out of the application. The implications of this change are: if a "remember me" cookie is hijacked, simply logging out of the application will invalidate the cookie.

### Upgrade Path

First, add a new, nullable `remember_token` of VARCHAR(100), TEXT, or equivalent to your `users` table.

Next, if you are using the Eloquent authentication driver, update your `User` class with the following three methods:

	public function getRememberToken()
	{
		return $this->remember_token;
	}

	public function setRememberToken($value)
	{
		$this->remember_token = $value;
	}

	public function getRememberTokenName()
	{
		return 'remember_token';
	}

> **Note:** All existing "remember me" sessions will be invalidated by this change, so all users will be forced to re-authenticate with your application.

### Package Maintainers

Two new methods were added to the `Illuminate\Auth\UserProviderInterface` interface. Sample implementations may be found in the default drivers:

	public function retrieveByToken($identifier, $token);

	public function updateRememberToken(UserInterface $user, $token);

The `Illuminate\Auth\UserInterface` also received the three new methods described in the "Upgrade Path".

## 從 4.0 升級到 4.1

### 升級你的 Composer 相依性

升級你的應用程式至 Laravel 4.1，將 `composer.json` 裡的 `laravel/framework` 版本更改至 `4.1.*`。

### 檔案置換

將你的 `public/index.php` 置換成 [這個 repository 的乾淨版本](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/public/index.php)。

同樣的，將你的 `artisan` 置換成 [這個 repository 的乾淨版本](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/artisan)。

### 新增設定檔案及選項

更新你在設定檔 `app/config/app.php` 裡的 `aliases` 和 `providers` 陣列。而更新的選項值可以在 [這個檔案](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/app/config/app.php) 中找到。請確定將你後來加入自定和套件所需的 providers / aliases 加回陣列中。

從 [這個 repository](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/app/config/remote.php) 增加 `app/config/remote.php` 檔案。

在你的 `app/config/session.php` 增加新的選項 `expire_on_close`。而預設值為 `false`。

在你的 `app/config/queue.php` 檔案裡新增 `failed` 設定區塊。以下為區塊的預設值：

	'failed' => array(
		'database' => 'mysql', 'table' => 'failed_jobs',
	),

**（非必要）** 在你的 `app/config/view.php` 裡，將 `pagination` 設定選項更新為 `pagination::slider-3`。

### 更新控制器（Controllers）

如果 `app/controllers/BaseController.php` 有 `use` 語句在最上面，將 `use Illuminate\Routing\Controllers\Controller;` 改為 `use Illuminate\Routing\Controller;`。

### 更新密碼提醒

密碼提醒功能已經大幅修正擁有更大的彈性。你可以執行 Artisan 指令 `php artisan auth:reminders-controller` 來檢查新的存根控制器。你也可以瀏覽 [更新文檔](/docs/security#password-reminders-and-reset) 然後相應的更新你的應用程式。

更新你的 `app/lang/en/reminders.php` 語系檔案來符合 [這個新版檔案](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/app/lang/en/reminders.php)。

### 更新環境偵測

為了安全因素，不再使用網域網址來偵測辨別應用程式的環境。因為這些直很容易被偽造欺騙，繼而讓攻擊者透過請求來達到變更環境。所以你必須改為使用機器的 hostname（在 Mac & Ubuntu 下執行 `hostname` 出來的值）

（譯按：的確原有方式有安全性考量，但對於現行 VirtualHost 大量使用下，反而這樣改會造成不便）

### 更簡單的日誌文件

Laravel 目前只會產生單一的日誌文件：`app/storage/logs/laravel.log`。然而，你還是可以透過設定你的 `app/start/global.php` 檔案來更改他的行為。

### 刪除重定向結尾的斜線

在你的 `bootstrap/start.php` 檔案中，移除呼叫 `$app->redirectIfTrailingSlash()`。這個方法已不再需要了，因為之後將會改以框架內的 `.htaccess` 來處理。

然後，用 [新版](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/public/.htaccess) 替換掉你 Apache 中的 `.htaccess` 檔案，來處理結尾的斜線問題。

### 取得目前路由

取得目前路由的方法由 `Route::getCurrentRoute()` 改為 `Route::current()`。

### Composer 更新

一旦你完成以上的更新，你可以執行 `composer update` 來更新應用程式的核心檔案。如果有 class load 錯誤，請在 `update` 之後加上 `--no-scripts`，如：`composer update --no-scripts`。

### 萬用字元事件監聽者

萬用字元事件監聽者不再添加事件為參數到你的處理函數。如果你需要尋找你觸發的事件你應該用 `Event::firing()`.
