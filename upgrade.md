## Upgrading To 5.5.42 From 5.5 (Security Release)

Laravel 5.5.42 is a security release of Laravel and is recommended as an immediate upgrade for all users. Laravel 5.5.42 also contains a breaking change to cookie encryption and serialization logic, so please read the following notes carefully when upgrading your application.

**This vulnerability may only be exploited if your application encryption key (`APP_KEY` environment variable) has been accessed by a malicious user.** Typically, it is not possible for users of your application to gain access to this value. However, ex-employees that had access to the encryption key may be able to use the key to attack your applications. If you have any reason to believe your encryption key is in the hands of a malicious party, you should **always** rotate the key to a new value.

### Cookie Serialization

Laravel 5.5.42 disables all serialization / unserialization of cookie values. Since all Laravel cookies are encrypted and signed, cookie values are typically considered safe from client tampering. **However, if your application's encryption key is in the hands of a malicious party, that party could craft cookie values using the encryption key and exploit vulnerabilities inherit to PHP object serialization / unserialization, such as calling arbitary class methods within your application.**

Disabling serialization on all cookie values will invalidate all of your application's sessions and users will need to log into the application again. In addition, any other encrypted cookies your application is setting will have invalid values. For this reason, you may wish to add additional logic to your application to validate that your custom cookie values match an expected list of values you expect; otherwise, you should discard them.

#### Configuring Cookie Serialization

Since this vulnerability is not able to be exploited without access to your application's encryption key, we have chosen to provide a way to re-enable encrypted cookie serialization while you make your application compatible with these changes. To enable / disable cookie serialization, you may change the static `serialize` property of the `App\Http\Middleware\EncryptCookies` [middleware](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/app/Http/Middleware/EncryptCookies.php):

    /**
     * Indicates if cookies should be serialized.
     *
     * @var bool
     */
    protected static $serialize = true;

> **Note:** When encrypted cookie serialization is enabled, your application will be vulnerable to attack if its encryption key is accessed by a malicious party. If you believe your key may be in the hands of a malicious party, you should rotate the key to a new value before enabling encrypted cookie serialization.

## Upgrading To 5.5.0 From 5.4

#### Estimated Upgrade Time: 1 Hour

> {note} We attempt to document every possible breaking change. Since some of these breaking changes are in obscure parts of the framework only a portion of these changes may actually affect your application.

### PHP

Laravel 5.5 requires PHP 7.0.0 or higher.

### Updating Dependencies

Update your `laravel/framework` dependency to `5.5.*` in your `composer.json` file. In addition, you should update your `phpunit/phpunit` dependency to `~6.0`. Next, add the `filp/whoops` package with version `~2.0` to the `require-dev` section of your `composer.json` file. Finally, in the `scripts` section of your `composer.json` file, add the `package:discover` command to the `post-autoload-dump` event:

    "scripts": {
        ...
        "post-autoload-dump": [
            "Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postAutoloadDump",
            "@php artisan package:discover"
        ],
    }

If you are using the `laravel/browser-kit-testing` package, you should update the package to `2.*` in your `composer.json` file.

Of course, don't forget to examine any 3rd party packages consumed by your application and verify you are using the proper version for Laravel 5.5 support.

#### Laravel Installer

> {tip} If you commonly use the Laravel installer via `laravel new`, you should update your Laravel installer package using the `composer global update` command.

#### Laravel Dusk

Laravel Dusk `2.0.0` has been released to provide compatibility with Laravel 5.5 and headless Chrome testing.

#### Pusher

The Pusher event broadcasting driver now requires version `~3.0` of the Pusher SDK.

#### Swift Mailer

Laravel 5.5 requires version `~6.0` of Swift Mailer.

### Artisan

#### Auto-Loading Commands

In Laravel 5.5, Artisan can automatically discover commands so that you do not have to manually register them in your kernel. To take advantage of this new feature, you should add the following line to the `commands` method of your  `App\Console\Kernel` class:

    $this->load(__DIR__.'/Commands');

#### The `fire` Method

Any `fire` methods present on your Artisan commands should be renamed to `handle`.

#### The `optimize` Command

With recent improvements to PHP op-code caching, the `optimize` Artisan command is no longer needed. You should remove any references to this command from your deployment scripts as it will be removed in a future release of Laravel.

### Authorization

> {note} When upgrading from Laravel 5.4 to 5.5, all `remember_me` cookies will be rendered invalid and users will be logged out.

#### The `authorizeResource` Controller Method

When passing a multi-word model name to the `authorizeResource` method, the resulting route segment will now be "snake" case, matching the behavior of resource controllers.

#### The `basic` and `onceBasic` Methods

`Auth::basic` and `Auth::onceBasic` now throw `\Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\UnauthorizedHttpException` rather than returning a `Response` when authentication fails. By default, this will still result in a 401 response being sent to the client. However, if your application logic checked the return value of `Auth::basic` in order to return a custom response or implement other behavior on authentication failure, you will now need to handle the `UnauthorizedHttpException` instead, either in a `catch` block or in your application's exception handler.

#### The `before` Policy Method

The `before` method of a policy class will not be called if the class doesn't contain a method matching the name of the ability being checked.

### Cache

#### Database Driver

If you are using the database cache driver, you should run `php artisan cache:clear` when deploying your upgraded Laravel 5.5 application for the first time.

### Eloquent

#### The `belongsToMany` Method

If you are overriding the `belongsToMany` method on your Eloquent model, you should update your method signature to reflect the addition of new arguments:

    /**
     * Define a many-to-many relationship.
     *
     * @param  string  $related
     * @param  string  $table
     * @param  string  $foreignPivotKey
     * @param  string  $relatedPivotKey
     * @param  string  $parentKey
     * @param  string  $relatedKey
     * @param  string  $relation
     * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany
     */
    public function belongsToMany($related, $table = null, $foreignPivotKey = null,
                                  $relatedPivotKey = null, $parentKey = null,
                                  $relatedKey = null, $relation = null)
    {
        //
    }

#### BelongsToMany `getQualifiedRelatedKeyName`

The `getQualifiedRelatedKeyName` method has been renamed to `getQualifiedRelatedPivotKeyName`.

#### BelongsToMany `getQualifiedForeignKeyName`

The `getQualifiedForeignKeyName` method has been renamed to `getQualifiedForeignPivotKeyName`.

#### Model `is` Method

If you are overriding the `is` method of your Eloquent model, you should remove the `Model` type-hint from the method. This allows the `is` method to receive `null` as an argument:

    /**
     * Determine if two models have the same ID and belong to the same table.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model|null  $model
     * @return bool
     */
    public function is($model)
    {
        //
    }

#### Model `$events` Property

The `$events` property on your models should be renamed to `$dispatchesEvents`. This change was made because of a high number of users needing to define an `events` relationship, which caused a conflict with the old property name.

#### Pivot `$parent` Property

The protected `$parent` property on the `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Pivot` class has been renamed to `$pivotParent`.

#### Relationship `create` Methods

The `BelongsToMany`, `HasOneOrMany`, and `MorphOneOrMany` classes' `create` methods have been modified to provide a default value for the `$attributes` argument. If you are overriding these methods, you should update your signatures to match the new definition:

    public function create(array $attributes = [])
    {
        //
    }

#### Soft Deleted Models

When deleting a "soft deleted" model, the `exists` property on the model will remain `true`.

#### `withCount` Column Formatting

When using an alias, the `withCount` method will no longer automatically append `_count` onto the resulting column name. For example, in Laravel 5.4, the following query would result in a `bar_count` column being added to the query:

    $users = User::withCount('foo as bar')->get();

However, in Laravel 5.5, the alias will be used exactly as it is given. If you would like to append `_count` to the resulting column, you must specify that suffix when defining the alias:

    $users = User::withCount('foo as bar_count')->get();

#### Model Methods & Attribute Names

To prevent accessing a model's private properties when using array access, it's no longer possible to have a model method with the same name as an attribute or property. Doing so will cause exceptions to be thrown when accessing the model's attributes via array access (`$user['name']`) or the `data_get` helper function.

### Exception Format

In Laravel 5.5, all exceptions, including validation exceptions, are converted into HTTP responses by the exception handler. In addition, the default format for JSON validation errors has changed. The new format conforms to the following convention:

    {
        "message": "The given data was invalid.",
        "errors": {
            "field-1": [
                "Error 1",
                "Error 2"
            ],
            "field-2": [
                "Error 1",
                "Error 2"
            ],
        }
    }

However, if you would like to maintain the Laravel 5.4 JSON error format, you may add the following method to your `App\Exceptions\Handler` class:

    use Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException;

    /**
     * Convert a validation exception into a JSON response.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @param  \Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException  $exception
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\JsonResponse
     */
    protected function invalidJson($request, ValidationException $exception)
    {
        return response()->json($exception->errors(), $exception->status);
    }

#### JSON Authentication Attempts

This change also affects the validation error formatting for authentication attempts made over JSON. In Laravel 5.5, JSON authentication failures will return the error messages following the new formatting convention described above.

#### A Note On Form Requests

If you were customizing the response format of an individual form request, you should now override the `failedValidation` method of that form request, and throw an `HttpResponseException` instance containing your custom response:

    use Illuminate\Http\Exceptions\HttpResponseException;

    /**
     * Handle a failed validation attempt.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\Validator  $validator
     * @return void
     *
     * @throws \Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException
     */
    protected function failedValidation(Validator $validator)
    {
        throw new HttpResponseException(response()->json(..., 422));
    }

### Filesystem

#### The `files` Method

The `files` method of the `Illuminate\Filesystem\Filesystem` class has changed its signature to add the `$hidden` argument and now returns an array of `SplFileInfo` objects, similar to the `allFiles` method. Previously, the `files` method returned an array of string path names. The new signature is as follows:

    public function files($directory, $hidden = false)

### Mail

#### Unused Parameters

The unused `$data` and `$callback` arguments were removed from the `Illuminate\Contracts\Mail\MailQueue` contract's `queue` and `later` methods:

    /**
     * Queue a new e-mail message for sending.
     *
     * @param  string|array|MailableContract  $view
     * @param  string  $queue
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function queue($view, $queue = null);

    /**
     * Queue a new e-mail message for sending after (n) seconds.
     *
     * @param  \DateTimeInterface|\DateInterval|int  $delay
     * @param  string|array|MailableContract  $view
     * @param  string  $queue
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function later($delay, $view, $queue = null);

### Queues

#### The `dispatch` Helper

If you would like to dispatch a job that runs immediately and returns a value from the `handle` method, you should use the `dispatch_now` or `Bus::dispatchNow` method to dispatch the job:

    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Bus;

    $value = dispatch_now(new Job);

    $value = Bus::dispatchNow(new Job);

### Requests

#### The `all` Method

If you are overriding the `all` method of the `Illuminate\Http\Request` class, you should update your method signature to reflect the new `$keys` argument:

    /**
     * Get all of the input and files for the request.
     *
     * @param  array|mixed  $keys
     * @return array
     */
    public function all($keys = null)
    {
        //
    }

#### The `has` Method

The `$request->has` method will now return `true` even if the input value is an empty string or `null`. A new `$request->filled` method has been added that provides the previous behavior of the `has` method.

#### The `intersect` Method

The `intersect` method has been removed. You may replicate this behavior using `array_filter` on a call to `$request->only`:

    return array_filter($request->only('foo'));

#### The `only` Method

The `only` method will now only return attributes that are actually present in the request payload. If you would like to preserve the old behavior of the `only` method, you may use the `all` method instead.

    return $request->all('foo');

#### The `request()` Helper

The `request` helper will no longer retrieve nested keys. If needed, you may use the `input` method of the request to achieve this behavior:

    return request()->input('filters.date');

### Testing

#### Authentication Assertions

Some authentication assertions were renamed for better consistency with the rest of the framework's assertions:

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">

- `seeIsAuthenticated` was renamed to `assertAuthenticated`.
- `dontSeeIsAuthenticated` was renamed to `assertGuest`.
- `seeIsAuthenticatedAs` was renamed to `assertAuthenticatedAs`.
- `seeCredentials` was renamed to `assertCredentials`.
- `dontSeeCredentials` was renamed to `assertInvalidCredentials`.

</div>

#### Mail Fake

If you are using the `Mail` fake to determine if a mailable was **queued** during a request, you should now use `Mail::assertQueued` instead of `Mail::assertSent`. This distinction allows you to specifically assert that the mail was queued for background sending and not sent during the request itself.

#### Tinker

Laravel Tinker now supports omitting namespaces when referring to your application classes. This feature requires an optimized Composer class-map, so you should add the `optimize-autoloader` directive to the `config` section of your `composer.json` file:

    "config": {
        ...
        "optimize-autoloader": true
    }

### Translation

#### The `LoaderInterface`

The `Illuminate\Translation\LoaderInterface` interface has been moved to `Illuminate\Contracts\Translation\Loader`.

### Validation

#### Validator Methods

All of the validator's validation methods are now `public` instead of `protected`.

### Views

#### Dynamic "With" Variable Names

When allowing the dynamic `__call` method to share variables with a view, these variables will automatically use "camel" case. For example, given the following:

    return view('pool')->withMaximumVotes(100);

The `maximumVotes` variable may be accessed in the template like so:

    {{ $maximumVotes }}

#### `@php` Blade Directive

The `@php` blade directive no longer accepts inline tags. Instead, use the full form of the directive:

    @php
        $teamMember = true;
    @endphp

### Miscellaneous

We also encourage you to view the changes in the `laravel/laravel` [GitHub repository](https://github.com/laravel/laravel). While many of these changes are not required, you may wish to keep these files in sync with your application. Some of these changes will be covered in this upgrade guide, but others, such as changes to configuration files or comments, will not be. You can easily view the changes with the [GitHub comparison tool](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/compare/5.4...5.5) and choose which updates are important to you.
