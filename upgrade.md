## Upgrading To 4.1 From 4.0

### Upgrading Your Composer Dependency

To upgrade your application to Laravel 4.1, change your `laravel/framework` version to `4.1.*` in your `composer.json` file.

### Replacing Files

Replace your `public/index.php` file with [this fresh copy from the repository](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/public/index.php) ([raw](https://raw.github.com/laravel/laravel/master/public/index.php)).

Replace your `artisan` file with [this fresh copy from the repository](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/artisan) ([raw](https://raw.github.com/laravel/laravel/master/artisan)).

### Adding Configuration Files & Options

Update your `aliases` and `providers` arrays in your `app/config/app.php` configuration file. The updated values for these arrays can be found [in this file](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/app/config/app.php). Be sure to add your custom and package service providers / aliases back to the arrays.

Add the new `app/config/remote.php` file [from the repository](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/app/config/remote.php) ([raw](https://raw.github.com/laravel/laravel/master/app/config/remote.php)).

Add the new `expire_on_close` configuration option to your `app/config/session.php` file. The default value should be `false`.

Add the new `failed` configuration section to your `app/config/queue.php` file. Here are the default values for the section:

	'failed' => array(
		'database' => 'mysql', 'table' => 'failed_jobs',
	),

**(Optional)** Update the `pagination` configuration option in your `app/config/view.php` file to `pagination::slider-3`.

### Controller Updates

If `app/controllers/BaseController.php` has a `use` statement at the top, change `use Illuminate\Routing\Controllers\Controller;` to `use Illuminate\Routing\Controller;`.

### Password Reminders Updates

Password reminders have been overhauled for greater flexibility. You may examine the new stub controller by running the `php artisan auth:reminders-controller` Artisan command. You may also browse the [updated documentation](/docs/security#password-reminders-and-reset) and update your application accordingly.

Update your `app/lang/en/reminders.php` language file to match [this updated file](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/app/lang/en/reminders.php).

### Environment Detection Updates

For security reasons, URL domains may no longer be used to detect your application environment. These values are easily spoofable and allow attackers to modify the environment for a request. You should convert your environment detection to use machine host names (`hostname` command on Mac & Ubuntu).

### Simpler Log Files

Laravel now generates a single log file: `app/storage/logs/laravel.log`. However, you may still configure this behavior in your `app/start/global.php` file.

### Removing Redirect Trailing Slash

In your `bootstrap/start.php` file, remove the call to `$app->redirectIfTrailingSlash()`. This method is no longer needed as this functionality is now handled by the `.htaccess` file included with the framework.

Next, replace your Apache `.htaccess` file with [this new one](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/public/.htaccess) that handles trailing slashes.

### Current Route Access

The current route is now accessed via `Route::current()` instead of `Route::getCurrentRoute()`.

### Composer Update

Once you have completed the changes above, you can run the `composer update` function to update your core application files! If you receive class load errors, try running the `update` command with the `--no-scripts` option enabled like so: `composer update --no-scripts`.
