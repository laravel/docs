## Introduction

Laravel Boost accelerates AI-assisted development by providing the essential context and structure that AI needs to generate high-quality, Laravel-specific code.

At its foundation, Laravel Boost is an MCP server equipped with over 15 specialized tools designed to streamline AI-assisted coding workflows. The package includes composable AI guidelines specifically crafted for Laravel ecosystem packages, ensuring consistent and framework-appropriate code generation.

Boost also features a powerful Documentation API that combines a built-in MCP tool with an extensive knowledge base containing over 17,000 pieces of Laravel-specific information, all enhanced by semantic search capabilities using embeddings for precise, context-aware results.

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

Laravel Boost can be installed via Composer:

```shell
composer require laravel/boost -w --dev
```

Next, install the MCP server and coding guidelines:

```shell
php artisan boost:install
```

Feel free to add the generated MCP configuration file, guideline files (`.mcp.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `junie/`, etc.) and `boost.json` configuration file to your application's `.gitignore` as these files are automatically re-generated when running `boost:install` and `boost:update`.

Once Laravel Boost has been installed, you're ready to start coding with Cursor, Claude Code, or your AI agent of choice.

<a name="keeping-guidelines-up-to-date"></a>
### Keeping Guidelines Up-to-Date

You may want to periodically update your local AI guidelines to ensure they reflect the latest versions of the Laravel ecosystem packages you have installed. To do so, you can use the `boost:update` Artisan command.

```shell
php artisan boost:update
```

You may also automate this process by adding it to your Composer "post-update-cmd" scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "post-update-cmd": [
      "@php artisan boost:update --ansi"
    ]
  }
}
```

| Package | Versions Supported |

<a name="adding-custom-ai-guidelines"></a>
## Adding Custom AI Guidelines

To augment Laravel Boost with your own custom AI guidelines, add `.blade.php` or `.md` files to your application's `.ai/guidelines/*` directory. These files will automatically be included with Laravel Boost's guidelines when you run `boost:install`.

<a name="overriding-boost-ai-guidelines"></a>
### Overriding Boost AI Guidelines

You can override Boost's built-in AI guidelines by creating your own custom guidelines with matching file paths. When you create a custom guideline that matches an existing Boost guideline path, Boost will use your custom version instead of the built-in one.

For example, to override Boost's "Inertia React v2 Form Guidance" guidelines, create a file at `.ai/guidelines/inertia-react/2/forms.blade.php`. When you run `boost:install`, Boost will include your custom guideline instead of the default one.

<a name="third-party-package-ai-guidelines"></a>
## Third-Party Package AI Guidelines

If you maintain a third-party package and would like Boost to include AI guidelines for it, you can do so by adding a `resources/boost/guidelines/core.blade.php` file to your package. When users of your package run `php artisan boost:install`, Boost will automatically load your guidelines.

AI guidelines should provide a short overview of what your package does, outline any required file structure or conventions, and explain how to create or use its main features (with example commands or code snippets). Keep them concise, actionable, and focused on best practices so AI can generate correct code for your users. Here is an example:

```php
## Package Name

This package provides [brief description of functionality].

### Features

- Feature 1: [clear & short description].
- Feature 2: [clear & short description]. Example usage:

@verbatim
<code-snippet name="How to use Feature 2" lang="php">
$result = PackageName::featureTwo($param1, $param2);
</code-snippet>
@endverbatim
```

<a name="manually-registering-the-boost-mcp-server"></a>
## Manually Registering the Boost MCP Server

Sometimes you may need to manually register the Laravel Boost MCP server with your editor of choice. You should register the MCP server using the following details:

<table>
<tr><td><strong>Command</strong></td><td><code>php</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Args</strong></td><td><code>artisan boost:mcp</code></td></tr>
</table>

JSON Example:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "laravel-boost": {
            "command": "php",
            "args": ["artisan", "boost:mcp"]
        }
    }
}
```

<a name="adding-support-for-other-ides-ai-agents"></a>
## Adding Support for Other IDEs / AI Agents

Boost works with many popular IDEs and AI agents out of the box. If your coding tool isn't supported yet, you can create your own agent and integrate it with Boost. To do this, create a class that extends `Laravel\Boost\Install\Agents\Agent` and implement one or both of the following contracts depending on what you need:

- `Laravel\Boost\Contracts\SupportsGuidelines` - Adds support for AI guidelines.
- `Laravel\Boost\Contracts\SupportsMcp` - Adds support for MCP.
- `Laravel\Boost\Contracts\SupportsSkills` - Adds support for Agent Skills.

<a name="writing-the-agent"></a>
### Writing the Agent

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App;

use Laravel\Boost\Contracts\SupportsGuidelines;
use Laravel\Boost\Contracts\SupportsMcp;
use Laravel\Boost\Contracts\SupportsSkills;
use Laravel\Boost\Install\Agents\Agent;

class CustomAgent extends Agent implements SupportsGuidelines, SupportsMcp, SupportsSkills
{
    // Your implementation...
}
```

For an example implementation, see [ClaudeCode.php](https://github.com/laravel/boost/blob/main/src/Install/Agents/ClaudeCode.php).

<a name="registering-the-agent"></a>
### Registering the Agent

Register your custom agent in the `boot` method of your application's `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Laravel\Boost\Boost;

public function boot(): void
{
    Boost::registerAgent('customagent', CustomAgent::class);
}
```

Once registered, your agent will be available for selection when running `php artisan boost:install`.
