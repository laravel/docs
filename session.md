## Introduction

Since HTTP driven applications are stateless, sessions provide a way to store information about the user across multiple requests. Laravel ships with a variety of session backends that are accessed through an expressive, unified API. Support for popular backends such as [Memcached](https://memcached.org), [Redis](https://redis.io), and databases is included out of the box.

<a name="configuration"></a>
### Configuration

The session configuration file is stored at `config/session.php`. Be sure to review the options available to you in this file. By default, Laravel is configured to use the `file` session driver, which will work well for many applications. In production applications, you may consider using the `memcached` or `redis` drivers for even faster session performance.

The session `driver` configuration option defines where session data will be stored for each request. Laravel ships with several great drivers out of the box:

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">

- `file` - sessions are stored in `storage/framework/sessions`.
- `cookie` - sessions are stored in secure, encrypted cookies.
- `database` - sessions are stored in a relational database.
- `memcached` / `redis` - sessions are stored in one of these fast, cache based stores.
- `array` - sessions are stored in a PHP array and will not be persisted.

</div>

> {tip} The array driver is used during [testing](/docs/{{version}}/testing) and prevents the data stored in the session from being persisted.

### Driver Prerequisites

#### Database

When using the `database` session driver, you will need to create a table to contain the session items. Below is an example `Schema` declaration for the table:

    Schema::create('sessions', function ($table) {
        $table->string('id')->unique();
        $table->unsignedInteger('user_id')->nullable();
        $table->string('ip_address', 45)->nullable();
        $table->text('user_agent')->nullable();
        $table->text('payload');
        $table->integer('last_activity');
    });

You may use the `session:table` Artisan command to generate this migration:

    php artisan session:table

    php artisan migrate

#### Redis

Before using Redis sessions with Laravel, you will need to install the `predis/predis` package (~1.0) via Composer. You may configure your Redis connections in the `database` configuration file. In the `session` configuration file, the `connection` option may be used to specify which Redis connection is used by the session.

## Using The Session

<a name="retrieving-data"></a>
### Retrieving Data

There are two primary ways of working with session data in Laravel: the global `session` helper and via a `Request` instance. First, let's look at accessing the session via a `Request` instance, which can be type-hinted on a controller method. Remember, controller method dependencies are automatically injected via the Laravel [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container):

    <?php

    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use Illuminate\Http\Request;
    use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

    class UserController extends Controller
    {
        /**
         * Show the profile for the given user.
         *
         * @param  Request  $request
         * @param  int  $id
         * @return Response
         */
        public function show(Request $request, $id)
        {
            $value = $request->session()->get('key');

            //
        }
    }

When you retrieve an item from the session, you may also pass a default value as the second argument to the `get` method. This default value will be returned if the specified key does not exist in the session. If you pass a `Closure` as the default value to the `get` method and the requested key does not exist, the `Closure` will be executed and its result returned:

    $value = $request->session()->get('key', 'default');

    $value = $request->session()->get('key', function () {
        return 'default';
    });

#### The Global Session Helper

You may also use the global `session` PHP function to retrieve and store data in the session. When the `session` helper is called with a single, string argument, it will return the value of that session key. When the helper is called with an array of key / value pairs, those values will be stored in the session:

    Route::get('home', function () {
        // Retrieve a piece of data from the session...
        $value = session('key');

        // Specifying a default value...
        $value = session('key', 'default');

        // Store a piece of data in the session...
        session(['key' => 'value']);
    });

> {tip} There is little practical difference between using the session via an HTTP request instance versus using the global `session` helper. Both methods are [testable](/docs/{{version}}/testing) via the `assertSessionHas` method which is available in all of your test cases.

#### Retrieving All Session Data

If you would like to retrieve all the data in the session, you may use the `all` method:

    $data = $request->session()->all();

#### Determining If An Item Exists In The Session

To determine if an item is present in the session, you may use the `has` method. The `has` method returns `true` if the item is present and is not `null`:

    if ($request->session()->has('users')) {
        //
    }

To determine if an item is present in the session, even if its value is `null`, you may use the `exists` method. The `exists` method returns `true` if the item is present:

    if ($request->session()->exists('users')) {
        //
    }

<a name="storing-data"></a>
### Storing Data

To store data in the session, you will typically use the `put` method or the `session` helper:

    // Via a request instance...
    $request->session()->put('key', 'value');

    // Via the global helper...
    session(['key' => 'value']);

#### Pushing To Array Session Values

The `push` method may be used to push a new value onto a session value that is an array. For example, if the `user.teams` key contains an array of team names, you may push a new value onto the array like so:

    $request->session()->push('user.teams', 'developers');

#### Retrieving & Deleting An Item

The `pull` method will retrieve and delete an item from the session in a single statement:

    $value = $request->session()->pull('key', 'default');

<a name="flash-data"></a>
### Flash Data

Sometimes you may wish to store items in the session only for the next request. You may do so using the `flash` method. Data stored in the session using this method will only be available during the subsequent HTTP request, and then will be deleted. Flash data is primarily useful for short-lived status messages:

    $request->session()->flash('status', 'Task was successful!');

If you need to keep your flash data around for several requests, you may use the `reflash` method, which will keep all of the flash data for an additional request. If you only need to keep specific flash data, you may use the `keep` method:

    $request->session()->reflash();

    $request->session()->keep(['username', 'email']);

<a name="deleting-data"></a>
### Deleting Data

The `forget` method will remove a piece of data from the session. If you would like to remove all data from the session, you may use the `flush` method:

    // Forget a single key...
    $request->session()->forget('key');

    // Forget multiple keys...
    $request->session()->forget(['key1', 'key2']);

    $request->session()->flush();

<a name="regenerating-the-session-id"></a>
### Regenerating The Session ID

Regenerating the session ID is often done in order to prevent malicious users from exploiting a [session fixation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation) attack on your application.

Laravel automatically regenerates the session ID during authentication if you are using the built-in `LoginController`; however, if you need to manually regenerate the session ID, you may use the `regenerate` method.

    $request->session()->regenerate();

## Adding Custom Session Drivers

<a name="implementing-the-driver"></a>
#### Implementing The Driver

Your custom session driver should implement the `SessionHandlerInterface`. This interface contains just a few simple methods we need to implement. A stubbed MongoDB implementation looks something like this:

    <?php

    namespace App\Extensions;

    class MongoSessionHandler implements \SessionHandlerInterface
    {
        public function open($savePath, $sessionName) {}
        public function close() {}
        public function read($sessionId) {}
        public function write($sessionId, $data) {}
        public function destroy($sessionId) {}
        public function gc($lifetime) {}
    }

> {tip} Laravel does not ship with a directory to contain your extensions. You are free to place them anywhere you like. In this example, we have created an `Extensions` directory to house the `MongoSessionHandler`.

Since the purpose of these methods is not readily understandable, let's quickly cover what each of the methods do:

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">

- The `open` method would typically be used in file based session store systems. Since Laravel ships with a `file` session driver, you will almost never need to put anything in this method. You can leave it as an empty stub. It is a fact of poor interface design (which we'll discuss later) that PHP requires us to implement this method.
- The `close` method, like the `open` method, can also usually be disregarded. For most drivers, it is not needed.
- The `read` method should return the string version of the session data associated with the given `$sessionId`. There is no need to do any serialization or other encoding when retrieving or storing session data in your driver, as Laravel will perform the serialization for you.
- The `write` method should write the given `$data` string associated with the `$sessionId` to some persistent storage system, such as MongoDB, Dynamo, etc.  Again, you should not perform any serialization - Laravel will have already handled that for you.
- The `destroy` method should remove the data associated with the `$sessionId` from persistent storage.
- The `gc` method should destroy all session data that is older than the given `$lifetime`, which is a UNIX timestamp. For self-expiring systems like Memcached and Redis, this method may be left empty.

</div>

<a name="registering-the-driver"></a>
#### Registering The Driver

Once your driver has been implemented, you are ready to register it with the framework. To add additional drivers to Laravel's session backend, you may use the `extend` method on the `Session` [facade](/docs/{{version}}/facades). You should call the `extend` method from the `boot` method of a [service provider](/docs/{{version}}/providers). You may do this from the existing `AppServiceProvider` or create an entirely new provider:

    <?php

    namespace App\Providers;

    use App\Extensions\MongoSessionHandler;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Session;
    use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

    class SessionServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
    {
        /**
         * Perform post-registration booting of services.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function boot()
        {
            Session::extend('mongo', function ($app) {
                // Return implementation of SessionHandlerInterface...
                return new MongoSessionHandler;
            });
        }

        /**
         * Register bindings in the container.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function register()
        {
            //
        }
    }

Once the session driver has been registered, you may use the `mongo` driver in your `config/session.php` configuration file.
