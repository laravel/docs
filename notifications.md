## Introduction

In addition to support for [sending email](/docs/{{version}}/mail), Laravel provides support for sending notifications across a variety of delivery channels, including email, SMS (via [Vonage](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/), formerly known as Nexmo), and [Slack](https://slack.com). In addition, a variety of [community built notification channels](https://laravel-notification-channels.com/about/#suggesting-a-new-channel) have been created to send notifications over dozens of different channels! Notifications may also be stored in a database so they may be displayed in your web interface.

Typically, notifications should be short, informational messages that notify users of something that occurred in your application. For example, if you are writing a billing application, you might send an "Invoice Paid" notification to your users via the email and SMS channels.

<a name="generating-notifications"></a>
## Generating Notifications

In Laravel, each notification is represented by a single class that is typically stored in the `app/Notifications` directory. Don't worry if you don't see this directory in your application - it will be created for you when you run the `make:notification` Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan make:notification InvoicePaid
```

This command will place a fresh notification class in your `app/Notifications` directory. Each notification class contains a `via` method and a variable number of message building methods, such as `toMail` or `toDatabase`, that convert the notification to a message tailored for that particular channel.

<a name="sending-notifications"></a>
## Sending Notifications

<a name="using-the-notifiable-trait"></a>
### Using The Notifiable Trait

Notifications may be sent in two ways: using the `notify` method of the `Notifiable` trait or using the `Notification` [facade](/docs/{{version}}/facades). The `Notifiable` trait is included on your application's `App\Models\User` model by default:

    <?php

    namespace App\Models;

    use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;

    class User extends Authenticatable
    {
        use Notifiable;
    }

The `notify` method that is provided by this trait expects to receive a notification instance:

    use App\Notifications\InvoicePaid;

    $user->notify(new InvoicePaid($invoice));

> **Note**  
> Remember, you may use the `Notifiable` trait on any of your models. You are not limited to only including it on your `User` model.

<a name="using-the-notification-facade"></a>
### Using The Notification Facade

Alternatively, you may send notifications via the `Notification` [facade](/docs/{{version}}/facades). This approach is useful when you need to send a notification to multiple notifiable entities such as a collection of users. To send notifications using the facade, pass all of the notifiable entities and the notification instance to the `send` method:

    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Notification;

    Notification::send($users, new InvoicePaid($invoice));

You can also send notifications immediately using the `sendNow` method. This method will send the notification immediately even if the notification implements the `ShouldQueue` interface:

    Notification::sendNow($developers, new DeploymentCompleted($deployment));

<a name="specifying-delivery-channels"></a>
### Specifying Delivery Channels

Every notification class has a `via` method that determines on which channels the notification will be delivered. Notifications may be sent on the `mail`, `database`, `broadcast`, `vonage`, and `slack` channels.

> **Note**  
> If you would like to use other delivery channels such as Telegram or Pusher, check out the community driven [Laravel Notification Channels website](http://laravel-notification-channels.com).

The `via` method receives a `$notifiable` instance, which will be an instance of the class to which the notification is being sent. You may use `$notifiable` to determine which channels the notification should be delivered on:

    /**
     * Get the notification's delivery channels.
     *
     * @return array<int, string>
     */
    public function via(object $notifiable): array
    {
        return $notifiable->prefers_sms ? ['vonage'] : ['mail', 'database'];
    }

<a name="queueing-notifications"></a>
### Queueing Notifications

> **Warning**  
> Before queueing notifications you should configure your queue and [start a worker](/docs/{{version}}/queues).

Sending notifications can take time, especially if the channel needs to make an external API call to deliver the notification. To speed up your application's response time, let your notification be queued by adding the `ShouldQueue` interface and `Queueable` trait to your class. The interface and trait are already imported for all notifications generated using the `make:notification` command, so you may immediately add them to your notification class:

    <?php

    namespace App\Notifications;

    use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
    use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

    class InvoicePaid extends Notification implements ShouldQueue
    {
        use Queueable;

        // ...
    }

Once the `ShouldQueue` interface has been added to your notification, you may send the notification like normal. Laravel will detect the `ShouldQueue` interface on the class and automatically queue the delivery of the notification:

    $user->notify(new InvoicePaid($invoice));

When queueing notifications, a queued job will be created for each recipient and channel combination. For example, six jobs will be dispatched to the queue if your notification has three recipients and two channels.

<a name="delaying-notifications"></a>
#### Delaying Notifications

If you would like to delay the delivery of the notification, you may chain the `delay` method onto your notification instantiation:

    $delay = now()->addMinutes(10);

    $user->notify((new InvoicePaid($invoice))->delay($delay));

<a name="delaying-notifications-per-channel"></a>
#### Delaying Notifications Per Channel

You may pass an array to the `delay` method to specify the delay amount for specific channels:

    $user->notify((new InvoicePaid($invoice))->delay([
        'mail' => now()->addMinutes(5),
        'sms' => now()->addMinutes(10),
    ]));

Alternatively, you may define a `withDelay` method on the notification class itself. The `withDelay` method should return an array of channel names and delay values:

    /**
     * Determine the notification's delivery delay.
     *
     * @return array<string, \Illuminate\Support\Carbon>
     */
    public function withDelay(object $notifiable): array
    {
        return [
            'mail' => now()->addMinutes(5),
            'sms' => now()->addMinutes(10),
        ];
    }

<a name="customizing-the-notification-queue-connection"></a>
#### Customizing The Notification Queue Connection

By default, queued notifications will be queued using your application's default queue connection. If you would like to specify a different connection that should be used for a particular notification, you may define a `$connection` property on the notification class:

    /**
     * The name of the queue connection to use when queueing the notification.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public $connection = 'redis';

Or, if you would like to specify a specific queue connection that should be used for each notification channel supported by the notification, you may define a `viaConnections` method on your notification. This method should return an array of channel name / queue connection name pairs:

    /**
     * Determine which connections should be used for each notification channel.
     *
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    public function viaConnections(): array
    {
        return [
            'mail' => 'redis',
            'database' => 'sync',
        ];
    }

<a name="customizing-notification-channel-queues"></a>
#### Customizing Notification Channel Queues

If you would like to specify a specific queue that should be used for each notification channel supported by the notification, you may define a `viaQueues` method on your notification. This method should return an array of channel name / queue name pairs:

    /**
     * Determine which queues should be used for each notification channel.
     *
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    public function viaQueues(): array
    {
        return [
            'mail' => 'mail-queue',
            'slack' => 'slack-queue',
        ];
    }

<a name="queued-notifications-and-database-transactions"></a>
#### Queued Notifications & Database Transactions

When queued notifications are dispatched within database transactions, they may be processed by the queue before the database transaction has committed. When this happens, any updates you have made to models or database records during the database transaction may not yet be reflected in the database. In addition, any models or database records created within the transaction may not exist in the database. If your notification depends on these models, unexpected errors can occur when the job that sends the queued notification is processed.

If your queue connection's `after_commit` configuration option is set to `false`, you may still indicate that a particular queued notification should be dispatched after all open database transactions have been committed by calling the `afterCommit` method when sending the notification:

    use App\Notifications\InvoicePaid;

    $user->notify((new InvoicePaid($invoice))->afterCommit());

Alternatively, you may call the `afterCommit` method from your notification's constructor:

    <?php

    namespace App\Notifications;

    use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
    use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

    class InvoicePaid extends Notification implements ShouldQueue
    {
        use Queueable;

        /**
         * Create a new notification instance.
         */
        public function __construct()
        {
            $this->afterCommit();
        }
    }

> **Note**  
> To learn more about working around these issues, please review the documentation regarding [queued jobs and database transactions](/docs/{{version}}/queues#jobs-and-database-transactions).

<a name="determining-if-the-queued-notification-should-be-sent"></a>
#### Determining If A Queued Notification Should Be Sent

After a queued notification has been dispatched for the queue for background processing, it will typically be accepted by a queue worker and sent to its intended recipient.

However, if you would like to make the final determination on whether the queued notification should be sent after it is being processed by a queue worker, you may define a `shouldSend` method on the notification class. If this method returns `false`, the notification will not be sent:

    /**
     * Determine if the notification should be sent.
     */
    public function shouldSend(object $notifiable, string $channel): bool
    {
        return $this->invoice->isPaid();
    }

<a name="on-demand-notifications"></a>
### On-Demand Notifications

Sometimes you may need to send a notification to someone who is not stored as a "user" of your application. Using the `Notification` facade's `route` method, you may specify ad-hoc notification routing information before sending the notification:

    use Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel;

    Notification::route('mail', 'taylor@example.com')
                ->route('vonage', '5555555555')
                ->route('slack', 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/...')
                ->route('broadcast', [new Channel('channel-name')])
                ->notify(new InvoicePaid($invoice));

If you would like to provide the recipient's name when sending an on-demand notification to the `mail` route, you may provide an array that contains the email address as the key and the name as the value of the first element in the array:

    Notification::route('mail', [
        'barrett@example.com' => 'Barrett Blair',
    ])->notify(new InvoicePaid($invoice));

<a name="mail-notifications"></a>
## Mail Notifications

<a name="formatting-mail-messages"></a>
### Formatting Mail Messages

If a notification supports being sent as an email, you should define a `toMail` method on the notification class. This method will receive a `$notifiable` entity and should return an `Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\MailMessage` instance.

The `MailMessage` class contains a few simple methods to help you build transactional email messages. Mail messages may contain lines of text as well as a "call to action". Let's take a look at an example `toMail` method:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        $url = url('/invoice/'.$this->invoice->id);

        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->greeting('Hello!')
                    ->line('One of your invoices has been paid!')
                    ->lineIf($this->amount > 0, "Amount paid: {$this->amount}")
                    ->action('View Invoice', $url)
                    ->line('Thank you for using our application!');
    }

> **Note**  
> Note we are using `$this->invoice->id` in our `toMail` method. You may pass any data your notification needs to generate its message into the notification's constructor.

In this example, we register a greeting, a line of text, a call to action, and then another line of text. These methods provided by the `MailMessage` object make it simple and fast to format small transactional emails. The mail channel will then translate the message components into a beautiful, responsive HTML email template with a plain-text counterpart. Here is an example of an email generated by the `mail` channel:

<img src="https://laravel.com/img/docs/notification-example-2.png">

> **Note**  
> When sending mail notifications, be sure to set the `name` configuration option in your `config/app.php` configuration file. This value will be used in the header and footer of your mail notification messages.

<a name="error-messages"></a>
#### Error Messages

Some notifications inform users of errors, such as a failed invoice payment. You may indicate that a mail message is regarding an error by calling the `error` method when building your message. When using the `error` method on a mail message, the call to action button will be red instead of black:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->error()
                    ->subject('Invoice Payment Failed')
                    ->line('...');
    }

<a name="other-mail-notification-formatting-options"></a>
#### Other Mail Notification Formatting Options

Instead of defining the "lines" of text in the notification class, you may use the `view` method to specify a custom template that should be used to render the notification email:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)->view(
            'emails.name', ['invoice' => $this->invoice]
        );
    }

You may specify a plain-text view for the mail message by passing the view name as the second element of an array that is given to the `view` method:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)->view(
            ['emails.name.html', 'emails.name.plain'],
            ['invoice' => $this->invoice]
        );
    }

<a name="customizing-the-sender"></a>
### Customizing The Sender

By default, the email's sender / from address is defined in the `config/mail.php` configuration file. However, you may specify the from address for a specific notification using the `from` method:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->from('barrett@example.com', 'Barrett Blair')
                    ->line('...');
    }

<a name="customizing-the-recipient"></a>
### Customizing The Recipient

When sending notifications via the `mail` channel, the notification system will automatically look for an `email` property on your notifiable entity. You may customize which email address is used to deliver the notification by defining a `routeNotificationForMail` method on the notifiable entity:

    <?php

    namespace App\Models;

    use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

    class User extends Authenticatable
    {
        use Notifiable;

        /**
         * Route notifications for the mail channel.
         *
         * @return  array<string, string>|string
         */
        public function routeNotificationForMail(Notification $notification): array|string
        {
            // Return email address only...
            return $this->email_address;

            // Return email address and name...
            return [$this->email_address => $this->name];
        }
    }

<a name="customizing-the-subject"></a>
### Customizing The Subject

By default, the email's subject is the class name of the notification formatted to "Title Case". So, if your notification class is named `InvoicePaid`, the email's subject will be `Invoice Paid`. If you would like to specify a different subject for the message, you may call the `subject` method when building your message:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->subject('Notification Subject')
                    ->line('...');
    }

<a name="customizing-the-mailer"></a>
### Customizing The Mailer

By default, the email notification will be sent using the default mailer defined in the `config/mail.php` configuration file. However, you may specify a different mailer at runtime by calling the `mailer` method when building your message:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->mailer('postmark')
                    ->line('...');
    }

<a name="customizing-the-templates"></a>
### Customizing The Templates

You can modify the HTML and plain-text template used by mail notifications by publishing the notification package's resources. After running this command, the mail notification templates will be located in the `resources/views/vendor/notifications` directory:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-notifications
```

<a name="mail-attachments"></a>
### Attachments

To add attachments to an email notification, use the `attach` method while building your message. The `attach` method accepts the absolute path to the file as its first argument:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->greeting('Hello!')
                    ->attach('/path/to/file');
    }

> **Note**  
> The `attach` method offered by notification mail messages also accepts [attachable objects](/docs/{{version}}/mail#attachable-objects). Please consult the comprehensive [attachable object documentation](/docs/{{version}}/mail#attachable-objects) to learn more.

When attaching files to a message, you may also specify the display name and / or MIME type by passing an `array` as the second argument to the `attach` method:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->greeting('Hello!')
                    ->attach('/path/to/file', [
                        'as' => 'name.pdf',
                        'mime' => 'application/pdf',
                    ]);
    }

Unlike attaching files in mailable objects, you may not attach a file directly from a storage disk using `attachFromStorage`. You should rather use the `attach` method with an absolute path to the file on the storage disk. Alternatively, you could return a [mailable](/docs/{{version}}/mail#generating-mailables) from the `toMail` method:

    use App\Mail\InvoicePaid as InvoicePaidMailable;

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): Mailable
    {
        return (new InvoicePaidMailable($this->invoice))
                    ->to($notifiable->email)
                    ->attachFromStorage('/path/to/file');
    }

When necessary, multiple files may be attached to a message using the `attachMany` method:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->greeting('Hello!')
                    ->attachMany([
                        '/path/to/forge.svg',
                        '/path/to/vapor.svg' => [
                            'as' => 'Logo.svg',
                            'mime' => 'image/svg+xml',
                        ],
                    ]);
    }

<a name="raw-data-attachments"></a>
#### Raw Data Attachments

The `attachData` method may be used to attach a raw string of bytes as an attachment. When calling the `attachData` method, you should provide the filename that should be assigned to the attachment:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->greeting('Hello!')
                    ->attachData($this->pdf, 'name.pdf', [
                        'mime' => 'application/pdf',
                    ]);
    }

<a name="adding-tags-metadata"></a>
### Adding Tags & Metadata

Some third-party email providers such as Mailgun and Postmark support message "tags" and "metadata", which may be used to group and track emails sent by your application. You may add tags and metadata to an email message via the `tag` and `metadata` methods:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->greeting('Comment Upvoted!')
                    ->tag('upvote')
                    ->metadata('comment_id', $this->comment->id);
    }

If your application is using the Mailgun driver, you may consult Mailgun's documentation for more information on [tags](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/user_manual.html#tagging-1) and [metadata](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/user_manual.html#attaching-data-to-messages). Likewise, the Postmark documentation may also be consulted for more information on their support for [tags](https://postmarkapp.com/blog/tags-support-for-smtp) and [metadata](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1125-custom-metadata-faq).

If your application is using Amazon SES to send emails, you should use the `metadata` method to attach [SES "tags"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/API_MessageTag.html) to the message.

<a name="customizing-the-symfony-message"></a>
### Customizing The Symfony Message

The `withSymfonyMessage` method of the `MailMessage` class allows you to register a closure which will be invoked with the Symfony Message instance before sending the message. This gives you an opportunity to deeply customize the message before it is delivered:

    use Symfony\Component\Mime\Email;

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->withSymfonyMessage(function (Email $message) {
                        $message->getHeaders()->addTextHeader(
                            'Custom-Header', 'Header Value'
                        );
                    });
    }

<a name="using-mailables"></a>
### Using Mailables

If needed, you may return a full [mailable object](/docs/{{version}}/mail) from your notification's `toMail` method. When returning a `Mailable` instead of a `MailMessage`, you will need to specify the message recipient using the mailable object's `to` method:

    use App\Mail\InvoicePaid as InvoicePaidMailable;
    use Illuminate\Mail\Mailable;

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): Mailable
    {
        return (new InvoicePaidMailable($this->invoice))
                    ->to($notifiable->email);
    }

<a name="mailables-and-on-demand-notifications"></a>
#### Mailables & On-Demand Notifications

If you are sending an [on-demand notification](#on-demand-notifications), the `$notifiable` instance given to the `toMail` method will be an instance of `Illuminate\Notifications\AnonymousNotifiable`, which offers a `routeNotificationFor` method that may be used to retrieve the email address the on-demand notification should be sent to:

    use App\Mail\InvoicePaid as InvoicePaidMailable;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\AnonymousNotifiable;
    use Illuminate\Mail\Mailable;

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): Mailable
    {
        $address = $notifiable instanceof AnonymousNotifiable
                ? $notifiable->routeNotificationFor('mail')
                : $notifiable->email;

        return (new InvoicePaidMailable($this->invoice))
                    ->to($address);
    }

<a name="previewing-mail-notifications"></a>
### Previewing Mail Notifications

When designing a mail notification template, it is convenient to quickly preview the rendered mail message in your browser like a typical Blade template. For this reason, Laravel allows you to return any mail message generated by a mail notification directly from a route closure or controller. When a `MailMessage` is returned, it will be rendered and displayed in the browser, allowing you to quickly preview its design without needing to send it to an actual email address:

    use App\Models\Invoice;
    use App\Notifications\InvoicePaid;

    Route::get('/notification', function () {
        $invoice = Invoice::find(1);

        return (new InvoicePaid($invoice))
                    ->toMail($invoice->user);
    });

<a name="markdown-mail-notifications"></a>
## Markdown Mail Notifications

Markdown mail notifications allow you to take advantage of the pre-built templates of mail notifications, while giving you more freedom to write longer, customized messages. Since the messages are written in Markdown, Laravel is able to render beautiful, responsive HTML templates for the messages while also automatically generating a plain-text counterpart.

<a name="generating-the-message"></a>
### Generating The Message

To generate a notification with a corresponding Markdown template, you may use the `--markdown` option of the `make:notification` Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan make:notification InvoicePaid --markdown=mail.invoice.paid
```

Like all other mail notifications, notifications that use Markdown templates should define a `toMail` method on their notification class. However, instead of using the `line` and `action` methods to construct the notification, use the `markdown` method to specify the name of the Markdown template that should be used. An array of data you wish to make available to the template may be passed as the method's second argument:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        $url = url('/invoice/'.$this->invoice->id);

        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->subject('Invoice Paid')
                    ->markdown('mail.invoice.paid', ['url' => $url]);
    }

<a name="writing-the-message"></a>
### Writing The Message

Markdown mail notifications use a combination of Blade components and Markdown syntax which allow you to easily construct notifications while leveraging Laravel's pre-crafted notification components:

```blade
<x-mail::message>
# Invoice Paid

Your invoice has been paid!

<x-mail::button :url="$url">
View Invoice
</x-mail::button>

Thanks,<br>
{{ config('app.name') }}
</x-mail::message>
```

<a name="button-component"></a>
#### Button Component

The button component renders a centered button link. The component accepts two arguments, a `url` and an optional `color`. Supported colors are `primary`, `green`, and `red`. You may add as many button components to a notification as you wish:

```blade
<x-mail::button :url="$url" color="green">
View Invoice
</x-mail::button>
```

<a name="panel-component"></a>
#### Panel Component

The panel component renders the given block of text in a panel that has a slightly different background color than the rest of the notification. This allows you to draw attention to a given block of text:

```blade
<x-mail::panel>
This is the panel content.
</x-mail::panel>
```

<a name="table-component"></a>
#### Table Component

The table component allows you to transform a Markdown table into an HTML table. The component accepts the Markdown table as its content. Table column alignment is supported using the default Markdown table alignment syntax:

```blade
<x-mail::table>
| Laravel       | Table         | Example  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| --------:|
| Col 2 is      | Centered      | $10      |
| Col 3 is      | Right-Aligned | $20      |
</x-mail::table>
```

<a name="customizing-the-components"></a>
### Customizing The Components

You may export all of the Markdown notification components to your own application for customization. To export the components, use the `vendor:publish` Artisan command to publish the `laravel-mail` asset tag:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-mail
```

This command will publish the Markdown mail components to the `resources/views/vendor/mail` directory. The `mail` directory will contain an `html` and a `text` directory, each containing their respective representations of every available component. You are free to customize these components however you like.

<a name="customizing-the-css"></a>
#### Customizing The CSS

After exporting the components, the `resources/views/vendor/mail/html/themes` directory will contain a `default.css` file. You may customize the CSS in this file and your styles will automatically be in-lined within the HTML representations of your Markdown notifications.

If you would like to build an entirely new theme for Laravel's Markdown components, you may place a CSS file within the `html/themes` directory. After naming and saving your CSS file, update the `theme` option of the `mail` configuration file to match the name of your new theme.

To customize the theme for an individual notification, you may call the `theme` method while building the notification's mail message. The `theme` method accepts the name of the theme that should be used when sending the notification:

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toMail(object $notifiable): MailMessage
    {
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->theme('invoice')
                    ->subject('Invoice Paid')
                    ->markdown('mail.invoice.paid', ['url' => $url]);
    }

<a name="database-notifications"></a>
## Database Notifications

<a name="database-prerequisites"></a>
### Prerequisites

The `database` notification channel stores the notification information in a database table. This table will contain information such as the notification type as well as a JSON data structure that describes the notification.

You can query the table to display the notifications in your application's user interface. But, before you can do that, you will need to create a database table to hold your notifications. You may use the `notifications:table` command to generate a [migration](/docs/{{version}}/migrations) with the proper table schema:

```shell
php artisan notifications:table

php artisan migrate
```

<a name="formatting-database-notifications"></a>
### Formatting Database Notifications

If a notification supports being stored in a database table, you should define a `toDatabase` or `toArray` method on the notification class. This method will receive a `$notifiable` entity and should return a plain PHP array. The returned array will be encoded as JSON and stored in the `data` column of your `notifications` table. Let's take a look at an example `toArray` method:

    /**
     * Get the array representation of the notification.
     *
     * @return array<string, mixed>
     */
    public function toArray(object $notifiable): array
    {
        return [
            'invoice_id' => $this->invoice->id,
            'amount' => $this->invoice->amount,
        ];
    }

<a name="todatabase-vs-toarray"></a>
#### `toDatabase` Vs. `toArray`

The `toArray` method is also used by the `broadcast` channel to determine which data to broadcast to your JavaScript powered frontend. If you would like to have two different array representations for the `database` and `broadcast` channels, you should define a `toDatabase` method instead of a `toArray` method.

<a name="accessing-the-notifications"></a>
### Accessing The Notifications

Once notifications are stored in the database, you need a convenient way to access them from your notifiable entities. The `Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable` trait, which is included on Laravel's default `App\Models\User` model, includes a `notifications` [Eloquent relationship](/docs/{{version}}/eloquent-relationships) that returns the notifications for the entity. To fetch notifications, you may access this method like any other Eloquent relationship. By default, notifications will be sorted by the `created_at` timestamp with the most recent notifications at the beginning of the collection:

    $user = App\Models\User::find(1);

    foreach ($user->notifications as $notification) {
        echo $notification->type;
    }

If you want to retrieve only the "unread" notifications, you may use the `unreadNotifications` relationship. Again, these notifications will be sorted by the `created_at` timestamp with the most recent notifications at the beginning of the collection:

    $user = App\Models\User::find(1);

    foreach ($user->unreadNotifications as $notification) {
        echo $notification->type;
    }

> **Note**  
> To access your notifications from your JavaScript client, you should define a notification controller for your application which returns the notifications for a notifiable entity, such as the current user. You may then make an HTTP request to that controller's URL from your JavaScript client.

<a name="marking-notifications-as-read"></a>
### Marking Notifications As Read

Typically, you will want to mark a notification as "read" when a user views it. The `Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable` trait provides a `markAsRead` method, which updates the `read_at` column on the notification's database record:

    $user = App\Models\User::find(1);

    foreach ($user->unreadNotifications as $notification) {
        $notification->markAsRead();
    }

However, instead of looping through each notification, you may use the `markAsRead` method directly on a collection of notifications:

    $user->unreadNotifications->markAsRead();

You may also use a mass-update query to mark all of the notifications as read without retrieving them from the database:

    $user = App\Models\User::find(1);

    $user->unreadNotifications()->update(['read_at' => now()]);

You may `delete` the notifications to remove them from the table entirely:

    $user->notifications()->delete();

<a name="broadcast-notifications"></a>
## Broadcast Notifications

<a name="broadcast-prerequisites"></a>
### Prerequisites

Before broadcasting notifications, you should configure and be familiar with Laravel's [event broadcasting](/docs/{{version}}/broadcasting) services. Event broadcasting provides a way to react to server-side Laravel events from your JavaScript powered frontend.

<a name="formatting-broadcast-notifications"></a>
### Formatting Broadcast Notifications

The `broadcast` channel broadcasts notifications using Laravel's [event broadcasting](/docs/{{version}}/broadcasting) services, allowing your JavaScript powered frontend to catch notifications in realtime. If a notification supports broadcasting, you can define a `toBroadcast` method on the notification class. This method will receive a `$notifiable` entity and should return a `BroadcastMessage` instance. If the `toBroadcast` method does not exist, the `toArray` method will be used to gather the data that should be broadcast. The returned data will be encoded as JSON and broadcast to your JavaScript powered frontend. Let's take a look at an example `toBroadcast` method:

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\BroadcastMessage;

    /**
     * Get the broadcastable representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toBroadcast(object $notifiable): BroadcastMessage
    {
        return new BroadcastMessage([
            'invoice_id' => $this->invoice->id,
            'amount' => $this->invoice->amount,
        ]);
    }

<a name="broadcast-queue-configuration"></a>
#### Broadcast Queue Configuration

All broadcast notifications are queued for broadcasting. If you would like to configure the queue connection or queue name that is used to queue the broadcast operation, you may use the `onConnection` and `onQueue` methods of the `BroadcastMessage`:

    return (new BroadcastMessage($data))
                    ->onConnection('sqs')
                    ->onQueue('broadcasts');

<a name="customizing-the-notification-type"></a>
#### Customizing The Notification Type

In addition to the data you specify, all broadcast notifications also have a `type` field containing the full class name of the notification. If you would like to customize the notification `type`, you may define a `broadcastType` method on the notification class:

    /**
     * Get the type of the notification being broadcast.
     */
    public function broadcastType(): string
    {
        return 'broadcast.message';
    }

<a name="listening-for-notifications"></a>
### Listening For Notifications

Notifications will broadcast on a private channel formatted using a `{notifiable}.{id}` convention. So, if you are sending a notification to an `App\Models\User` instance with an ID of `1`, the notification will be broadcast on the `App.Models.User.1` private channel. When using [Laravel Echo](/docs/{{version}}/broadcasting#client-side-installation), you may easily listen for notifications on a channel using the `notification` method:

    Echo.private('App.Models.User.' + userId)
        .notification((notification) => {
            console.log(notification.type);
        });

<a name="customizing-the-notification-channel"></a>
#### Customizing The Notification Channel

If you would like to customize which channel that an entity's broadcast notifications are broadcast on, you may define a `receivesBroadcastNotificationsOn` method on the notifiable entity:

    <?php

    namespace App\Models;

    use Illuminate\Broadcasting\PrivateChannel;
    use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;

    class User extends Authenticatable
    {
        use Notifiable;

        /**
         * The channels the user receives notification broadcasts on.
         */
        public function receivesBroadcastNotificationsOn(): string
        {
            return 'users.'.$this->id;
        }
    }

<a name="sms-notifications"></a>
## SMS Notifications

<a name="sms-prerequisites"></a>
### Prerequisites

Sending SMS notifications in Laravel is powered by [Vonage](https://www.vonage.com/) (formerly known as Nexmo). Before you can send notifications via Vonage, you need to install the `laravel/vonage-notification-channel` and `guzzlehttp/guzzle` packages:

    composer require laravel/vonage-notification-channel guzzlehttp/guzzle

The package includes a [configuration file](https://github.com/laravel/vonage-notification-channel/blob/3.x/config/vonage.php). However, you are not required to export this configuration file to your own application. You can simply use the `VONAGE_KEY` and `VONAGE_SECRET` environment variables to define your Vonage public and secret keys.

After defining your keys, you may set a `VONAGE_SMS_FROM` environment variable that defines the phone number that your SMS messages should be sent from by default. You may generate this phone number within the Vonage control panel:

    VONAGE_SMS_FROM=15556666666

<a name="formatting-sms-notifications"></a>
### Formatting SMS Notifications

If a notification supports being sent as an SMS, you should define a `toVonage` method on the notification class. This method will receive a `$notifiable` entity and should return an `Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\VonageMessage` instance:

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\VonageMessage;

    /**
     * Get the Vonage / SMS representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toVonage(object $notifiable): VonageMessage
    {
        return (new VonageMessage)
                    ->content('Your SMS message content');
    }

<a name="unicode-content"></a>
#### Unicode Content

If your SMS message will contain unicode characters, you should call the `unicode` method when constructing the `VonageMessage` instance:

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\VonageMessage;

    /**
     * Get the Vonage / SMS representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toVonage(object $notifiable): VonageMessage
    {
        return (new VonageMessage)
                    ->content('Your unicode message')
                    ->unicode();
    }

<a name="customizing-the-from-number"></a>
### Customizing The "From" Number

If you would like to send some notifications from a phone number that is different from the phone number specified by your `VONAGE_SMS_FROM` environment variable, you may call the `from` method on a `VonageMessage` instance:

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\VonageMessage;

    /**
     * Get the Vonage / SMS representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toVonage(object $notifiable): VonageMessage
    {
        return (new VonageMessage)
                    ->content('Your SMS message content')
                    ->from('15554443333');
    }

<a name="adding-a-client-reference"></a>
### Adding a Client Reference

If you would like to keep track of costs per user, team, or client, you may add a "client reference" to the notification. Vonage will allow you to generate reports using this client reference so that you can better understand a particular customer's SMS usage. The client reference can be any string up to 40 characters:

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\VonageMessage;

    /**
     * Get the Vonage / SMS representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toVonage(object $notifiable): VonageMessage
    {
        return (new VonageMessage)
                    ->clientReference((string) $notifiable->id)
                    ->content('Your SMS message content');
    }

<a name="routing-sms-notifications"></a>
### Routing SMS Notifications

To route Vonage notifications to the proper phone number, define a `routeNotificationForVonage` method on your notifiable entity:

    <?php

    namespace App\Models;

    use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

    class User extends Authenticatable
    {
        use Notifiable;

        /**
         * Route notifications for the Vonage channel.
         */
        public function routeNotificationForVonage(Notification $notification): string
        {
            return $this->phone_number;
        }
    }

<a name="slack-notifications"></a>
## Slack Notifications

<a name="slack-prerequisites"></a>
### Prerequisites

Before you can send notifications via Slack, you must install the Slack notification channel via Composer:

```shell
composer require laravel/slack-notification-channel
```

You will also need to create a [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) for your team. After creating the App, you should configure an "Incoming Webhook" for the workspace. Slack will then provide you with a webhook URL that you may use when [routing Slack notifications](#routing-slack-notifications).

<a name="formatting-slack-notifications"></a>
### Formatting Slack Notifications

If a notification supports being sent as a Slack message, you should define a `toSlack` method on the notification class. This method will receive a `$notifiable` entity and should return an `Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SlackMessage` instance. Slack messages may contain text content as well as an "attachment" that formats additional text or an array of fields. Let's take a look at a basic `toSlack` example:

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SlackMessage;

    /**
     * Get the Slack representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toSlack(object $notifiable): SlackMessage
    {
        return (new SlackMessage)
                    ->content('One of your invoices has been paid!');
    }

<a name="slack-attachments"></a>
### Slack Attachments

You may also add "attachments" to Slack messages. Attachments provide richer formatting options than simple text messages. In this example, we will send an error notification about an exception that occurred in an application, including a link to view more details about the exception:

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SlackAttachment;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SlackMessage;

    /**
     * Get the Slack representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toSlack(object $notifiable): SlackMessage
    {
        $url = url('/exceptions/'.$this->exception->id);

        return (new SlackMessage)
                    ->error()
                    ->content('Whoops! Something went wrong.')
                    ->attachment(function (SlackAttachment $attachment) use ($url) {
                        $attachment->title('Exception: File Not Found', $url)
                                   ->content('File [background.jpg] was not found.');
                    });
    }

Attachments also allow you to specify an array of data that should be presented to the user. The given data will be presented in a table-style format for easy reading:

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SlackAttachment;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SlackMessage;

    /**
     * Get the Slack representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toSlack(object $notifiable): SlackMessage
    {
        $url = url('/invoices/'.$this->invoice->id);

        return (new SlackMessage)
                    ->success()
                    ->content('One of your invoices has been paid!')
                    ->attachment(function (SlackAttachment $attachment) use ($url) {
                        $attachment->title('Invoice 1322', $url)
                                   ->fields([
                                        'Title' => 'Server Expenses',
                                        'Amount' => '$1,234',
                                        'Via' => 'American Express',
                                        'Was Overdue' => ':-1:',
                                    ]);
                    });
    }

<a name="markdown-attachment-content"></a>
#### Markdown Attachment Content

If some of your attachment fields contain Markdown, you may use the `markdown` method to instruct Slack to parse and display the given attachment fields as Markdown formatted text. The values accepted by this method are: `pretext`, `text`, and / or `fields`. For more information about Slack attachment formatting, check out the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting#message_formatting):

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SlackAttachment;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\SlackMessage;

    /**
     * Get the Slack representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toSlack(object $notifiable): SlackMessage
    {
        $url = url('/exceptions/'.$this->exception->id);

        return (new SlackMessage)
                    ->error()
                    ->content('Whoops! Something went wrong.')

### Routing Slack Notifications

To route Slack notifications to the proper Slack team and channel, define a `routeNotificationForSlack` method on your notifiable entity. This should return the webhook URL to which the notification should be delivered. Webhook URLs may be generated by adding an "Incoming Webhook" service to your Slack team:

    <?php

    namespace App\Models;

    use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

    class User extends Authenticatable
    {
        use Notifiable;

        /**
         * Route notifications for the Slack channel.
         */
        public function routeNotificationForSlack(Notification $notification): string
        {
            return 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/...';
        }
    }

## Localizing Notifications

Laravel allows you to send notifications in a locale other than the HTTP request's current locale, and will even remember this locale if the notification is queued.

To accomplish this, the `Illuminate\Notifications\Notification` class offers a `locale` method to set the desired language. The application will change into this locale when the notification is being evaluated and then revert back to the previous locale when evaluation is complete:

    $user->notify((new InvoicePaid($invoice))->locale('es'));

Localization of multiple notifiable entries may also be achieved via the `Notification` facade:

    Notification::locale('es')->send(
        $users, new InvoicePaid($invoice)
    );

### User Preferred Locales

Sometimes, applications store each user's preferred locale. By implementing the `HasLocalePreference` contract on your notifiable model, you may instruct Laravel to use this stored locale when sending a notification:

    use Illuminate\Contracts\Translation\HasLocalePreference;

    class User extends Model implements HasLocalePreference
    {
        /**
         * Get the user's preferred locale.
         */
        public function preferredLocale(): string
        {
            return $this->locale;
        }
    }

Once you have implemented the interface, Laravel will automatically use the preferred locale when sending notifications and mailables to the model. Therefore, there is no need to call the `locale` method when using this interface:

    $user->notify(new InvoicePaid($invoice));

## Notification Events

<a name="notification-sending-event"></a>
#### Notification Sending Event

When a notification is sending, the `Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSending` [event](/docs/{{version}}/events) is dispatched by the notification system. This contains the "notifiable" entity and the notification instance itself. You may register listeners for this event in your application's `EventServiceProvider`:

    use App\Listeners\CheckNotificationStatus;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSending;
    
    /**
     * The event listener mappings for the application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $listen = [
        NotificationSending::class => [
            CheckNotificationStatus::class,
        ],
    ];

The notification will not be sent if an event listener for the `NotificationSending` event returns `false` from its `handle` method:

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSending;

    /**
     * Handle the event.
     */
    public function handle(NotificationSending $event): void
    {
        return false;
    }

Within an event listener, you may access the `notifiable`, `notification`, and `channel` properties on the event to learn more about the notification recipient or the notification itself:

    /**
     * Handle the event.
     */
    public function handle(NotificationSending $event): void
    {
        // $event->channel
        // $event->notifiable
        // $event->notification
    }

<a name="notification-sent-event"></a>
#### Notification Sent Event

When a notification is sent, the `Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSent` [event](/docs/{{version}}/events) is dispatched by the notification system. This contains the "notifiable" entity and the notification instance itself. You may register listeners for this event in your `EventServiceProvider`:

    use App\Listeners\LogNotification;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Events\NotificationSent;
    
    /**
     * The event listener mappings for the application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $listen = [
        NotificationSent::class => [
            LogNotification::class,
        ],
    ];

> **Note**  
> After registering listeners in your `EventServiceProvider`, use the `event:generate` Artisan command to quickly generate listener classes.

Within an event listener, you may access the `notifiable`, `notification`, `channel`, and `response` properties on the event to learn more about the notification recipient or the notification itself:

    /**
     * Handle the event.
     */
    public function handle(NotificationSent $event): void
    {
        // $event->channel
        // $event->notifiable
        // $event->notification
        // $event->response
    }

<a name="custom-channels"></a>
## Custom Channels

Laravel ships with a handful of notification channels, but you may want to write your own drivers to deliver notifications via other channels. Laravel makes it simple. To get started, define a class that contains a `send` method. The method should receive two arguments: a `$notifiable` and a `$notification`.

Within the `send` method, you may call methods on the notification to retrieve a message object understood by your channel and then send the notification to the `$notifiable` instance however you wish:

    <?php

    namespace App\Notifications;

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

    class VoiceChannel
    {
        /**
         * Send the given notification.
         */
        public function send(object $notifiable, Notification $notification): void
        {
            $message = $notification->toVoice($notifiable);

            // Send notification to the $notifiable instance...
        }
    }

Once your notification channel class has been defined, you may return the class name from the `via` method of any of your notifications. In this example, the `toVoice` method of your notification can return whatever object you choose to represent voice messages. For example, you might define your own `VoiceMessage` class to represent these messages:

    <?php

    namespace App\Notifications;

    use App\Notifications\Messages\VoiceMessage;
    use App\Notifications\VoiceChannel;
    use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
    use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

    class InvoicePaid extends Notification
    {
        use Queueable;

        /**
         * Get the notification channels.
         */
        public function via(object $notifiable): string
        {
            return VoiceChannel::class;
        }

        /**
         * Get the voice representation of the notification.
         */
        public function toVoice(object $notifiable): VoiceMessage
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
