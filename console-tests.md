## Introduction

In addition to simplifying HTTP testing, Laravel provides a simple API for testing your application's [custom console commands](/docs/{{version}}/artisan).

## Success / Failure Expectations

To get started, let's explore how to make assertions regarding an Artisan command's exit code. To accomplish this, we will use the `artisan` method to invoke an Artisan command from our test. Then, we will use the `assertExitCode` method to assert that the command completed with a given exit code:

```php tab=Pest
test('console command', function () {
    $this->artisan('inspire')->assertExitCode(0);
});
```

```php tab=PHPUnit
/**
 * Test a console command.
 */
public function test_console_command(): void
{
    $this->artisan('inspire')->assertExitCode(0);
}
```

You may use the `assertNotExitCode` method to assert that the command did not exit with a given exit code:

    $this->artisan('inspire')->assertNotExitCode(1);

Of course, all terminal commands typically exit with a status code of `0` when they are successful and a non-zero exit code when they are not successful. Therefore, for convenience, you may utilize the `assertSuccessful` and `assertFailed` assertions to assert that a given command exited with a successful exit code or not:

    $this->artisan('inspire')->assertSuccessful();

    $this->artisan('inspire')->assertFailed();

## Input / Output Expectations

Laravel allows you to easily "mock" user input for your console commands using the `expectsQuestion` method. In addition, you may specify the exit code and text that you expect to be output by the console command using the `assertExitCode` and `expectsOutput` methods. For example, consider the following console command:

    Artisan::command('question', function () {
        $name = $this->ask('What is your name?');

        $language = $this->choice('Which language do you prefer?', [
            'PHP',
            'Ruby',
            'Python',
        ]);

        $this->line('Your name is '.$name.' and you prefer '.$language.'.');
    });

You may test this command with the following test:

```php tab=Pest
test('console command', function () {
    $this->artisan('question')
         ->expectsQuestion('What is your name?', 'Taylor Otwell')
         ->expectsQuestion('Which language do you prefer?', 'PHP')
         ->expectsOutput('Your name is Taylor Otwell and you prefer PHP.')
         ->doesntExpectOutput('Your name is Taylor Otwell and you prefer Ruby.')
         ->assertExitCode(0);
});
```

```php tab=PHPUnit
/**
 * Test a console command.
 */
public function test_console_command(): void
{
    $this->artisan('question')
         ->expectsQuestion('What is your name?', 'Taylor Otwell')
         ->expectsQuestion('Which language do you prefer?', 'PHP')
         ->expectsOutput('Your name is Taylor Otwell and you prefer PHP.')
         ->doesntExpectOutput('Your name is Taylor Otwell and you prefer Ruby.')
         ->assertExitCode(0);
}
```

If you are utilizing the `search` or `multisearch` functions provided by [Laravel Prompts](/docs/{{version}}/prompts), you may use the `expectsSearch` assertion to mock the user's input, search results, and selection:

```php tab=Pest
test('console command', function () {
    $this->artisan('example')
         ->expectsSearch('What is your name?', search: 'Tay', answers: [
            'Taylor Otwell',
            'Taylor Swift',
            'Darian Taylor'
         ], answer: 'Taylor Otwell')
         ->assertExitCode(0);
});
```

```php tab=PHPUnit
/**
 * Test a console command.
 */
public function test_console_command(): void
{
    $this->artisan('example')
         ->expectsSearch('What is your name?', search: 'Tay', answers: [
            'Taylor Otwell',
            'Taylor Swift',
            'Darian Taylor'
         ], answer: 'Taylor Otwell')
         ->assertExitCode(0);
}
```

You may also assert that a console command does not generate any output using the `doesntExpectOutput` method:

```php tab=Pest
test('console command', function () {
    $this->artisan('example')
         ->doesntExpectOutput()
         ->assertExitCode(0);
});
```

```php tab=PHPUnit
/**
 * Test a console command.
 */
public function test_console_command(): void
{
    $this->artisan('example')
            ->doesntExpectOutput()
            ->assertExitCode(0);
}
```

The `expectsOutputToContain` and `doesntExpectOutputToContain` methods may be used to make assertions against a portion of the output:

```php tab=Pest
test('console command', function () {
    $this->artisan('example')
         ->expectsOutputToContain('Taylor')
         ->assertExitCode(0);
});
```

```php tab=PHPUnit
/**
 * Test a console command.
 */
public function test_console_command(): void
{
    $this->artisan('example')
            ->expectsOutputToContain('Taylor')
            ->assertExitCode(0);
}
```

#### Confirmation Expectations

When writing a command which expects confirmation in the form of a "yes" or "no" answer, you may utilize the `expectsConfirmation` method:

    $this->artisan('module:import')
        ->expectsConfirmation('Do you really wish to run this command?', 'no')
        ->assertExitCode(1);

<a name="table-expectations"></a>
#### Table Expectations

If your command displays a table of information using Artisan's `table` method, it can be cumbersome to write output expectations for the entire table. Instead, you may use the `expectsTable` method. This method accepts the table's headers as its first argument and the table's data as its second argument:

    $this->artisan('users:all')
        ->expectsTable([
            'ID',
            'Email',
        ], [
            [1, 'taylor@example.com'],
            [2, 'abigail@example.com'],
        ]);

<a name="console-events"></a>
## Console Events

By default, the `Illuminate\Console\Events\CommandStarting` and `Illuminate\Console\Events\CommandFinished` events are not dispatched while running your application's tests. However, you can enable these events for a given test class by adding the `Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\WithConsoleEvents` trait to the class:

```php tab=Pest
<?php

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\WithConsoleEvents;

uses(WithConsoleEvents::class);

// ...
```

```php tab=PHPUnit
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\WithConsoleEvents;
use Tests\TestCase;

class ConsoleEventTest extends TestCase
{
    use WithConsoleEvents;

    // ...
}
```
