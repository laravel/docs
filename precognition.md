## Introduction

Laravel Precognition allows you to anticipate the outcome of a future HTTP request. One of the primary use cases of Precognition is the ability to provide "live" validation for your frontend JavaScript application without having to duplicate your application's backend validation rules. Precognition pairs especially well with Laravel's Inertia-based [starter kits](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits).

When Laravel receives a "precognitive request", it will execute all of the route's middleware and resolve the route's controller dependencies, including validating [form requests](/docs/{{version}}/validation#form-request-validation) - but it will not actually execute the route's controller method.

## Live Validation

<a name="using-vue"></a>
### Using Vue

Using Laravel Precognition, you can offer live validation experiences to your users without having to duplicate your validation rules in your frontend Vue application. To illustrate how it works, let's build a form for creating new users within our application.

First, to enable Precognition for a route, the `HandlePrecognitiveRequests` middleware should be added to the route definition. You should also create a [form request](/docs/{{version}}/validation#form-request-validation) to house the route's validation rules:

```php
use App\Http\Requests\StoreUserRequest;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\HandlePrecognitiveRequests;

Route::post('/users', function (StoreUserRequest $request) {
    // ...
})->middleware([HandlePrecognitiveRequests::class]);
```

Next, you should install the Laravel Precognition frontend helpers for Vue via NPM:

```shell
npm install laravel-precognition-vue
```

With the Laravel Precognition package installed, you can now create a form object using Precognition's `useForm` function, providing the HTTP method (`post`), the target URL (`/users`), and the initial form data.

Then, to enable live validation, invoke the form's `validate` method on each input's `change` event, providing the input's name:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useForm } from 'laravel-precognition-vue';

const form = useForm('post', '/users', {
    name: '',
    email: '',
});

const submit = () => form.submit();
</script>

<template>
    <form @submit.prevent="submit">
        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <input
            id="name"
            v-model="form.name"
            @change="form.validate('name')"
        />
        <div v-if="form.invalid('name')">
            {{ form.errors.name }}
        </div>

        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input
            id="email"
            type="email"
            v-model="form.email"
            @change="form.validate('email')"
        />
        <div v-if="form.invalid('email')">
            {{ form.errors.email }}
        </div>

        <button>Create User</button>
    </form>
</template>
```

Now, as the form is filled by the user, Precognition will provide live validation output powered by the validation rules in the route's form request. When the form's inputs are changed, a debounced "precognitive" validation request will be sent to your Laravel application. You may configure the debounce timeout by calling the form's `setValidationTimeout` function:

```js
form.setValidationTimeout(3000);
```

When a validation request is in-flight, the form's `validating` property will be `true`:

```html
<div v-if="form.validating">
    Validating...
</div>
```

Any validation errors returned during a validation request or a form submission will automatically populate the form's `errors` object:

```html
<div v-if="form.invalid('email')">
    {{ form.errors.email }}
</div>
```

You can determine if the form has any errors using the form's `hasErrors` property:

```html
<div v-if="form.hasErrors">
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

You may also determine if an input has passed or failed validation by passing the input's name to the form's `valid` and `invalid` functions, respectively:

```html
<span v-if="form.valid('email')">
    ✅
</span>

<span v-else-if="form.invalid('email')">
    ❌
</span>
```

> **Warning**
> A form input will only appear as valid or invalid once it has changed and a validation response has been received.

Of course, you may also execute code in reaction to the response to the form submission. The form's `submit` function returns an Axios request promise. This provides a convenient way to access the response payload, reset the form inputs on successful submission, or handle a failed request:

```js
const submit = () => form.submit()
    .then(response => {
        form.reset();

        alert('User created.');
    })
    .catch(error => {
        alert('An error occurred.');
    });
```

### Using Vue & Inertia

> **Note**
> If you would like a head start when developing your Laravel application with Vue and Inertia, consider using one of our [starter kits](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits). Laravel's starter kits provide backend and frontend authentication scaffolding for your new Laravel application.

Before using Precognition with Vue and Inertia, be sure to review our general documentation on [using Precognition with Vue](#using-vue). When using Vue with Inertia, you will need to install the Inertia compatible Precognition library via NPM:

```shell
npm install laravel-precognition-vue-inertia
```

Once installed, Precognition's `useForm` function will return an Inertia [form helper](https://inertiajs.com/forms#form-helper) augmented with the validation features discussed above.

The form helper's `submit` method has been streamlined, removing the need to specify the HTTP method or URL. Instead, you may pass Inertia's [visit options](https://inertiajs.com/manual-visits) as the first and only argument. In addition, the `submit` method does not return a Promise as seen in the Vue example above. Instead, you may provide any of Inertia's supported [event callbacks](https://inertiajs.com/manual-visits#event-callbacks) in the visit options given to the `submit` method:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useForm } from 'laravel-precognition-vue-inertia';

const form = useForm('post', '/users', {
    name: '',
    email: '',
});

const submit = () => form.submit({
    preserveScroll: true,
    onSuccess: () => form.reset(),
});
</script>
```

### Using React

Using Laravel Precognition, you can offer live validation experiences to your users without having to duplicate your validation rules in your frontend React application. To illustrate how it works, let's build a form for creating new users within our application.

First, to enable Precognition for a route, the `HandlePrecognitiveRequests` middleware should be added to the route definition. You should also create a [form request](/docs/{version}/validation#form-request-validation) to house the route's validation rules:

```php
use App\Http\Requests\StoreUserRequest;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\HandlePrecognitiveRequests;

Route::post('/users', function (StoreUserRequest $request) {
    // ...
})->middleware([HandlePrecognitiveRequests::class]);
```

Next, you should install the Laravel Precognition frontend helpers for React via NPM:

```shell
npm install laravel-precognition-react
```

With the Laravel Precognition package installed, you can now create a form object using Precognition's `useForm` function, providing the HTTP method (`post`), the target URL (`/users`), and the initial form data.

To enable live validation, you should listen to each input's `change` and `blur` event. In the `change` event handler, you should set the form's data with the `setData` function, passing the input's name and new value. Then, in the `blur` event handler invoke the form's `validate` method, providing the input's name:

```jsx
import { useForm } from 'laravel-precognition-react';

export default function Form() {
    const form = useForm('post', '/users', {
        name: '',
        email: '',
    });

    const submit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();

        form.submit();
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={submit}>
            <label for="name">Name</label>
            <input
                id="name"
                value={form.data.name}
                onChange={(e) => form.setData('name', e.target.value)}
                onBlur={() => form.validate('name')}
            />
            {form.invalid('name') && <div>{form.errors.name}</div>}

            <label for="email">Email</label>
            <input
                id="email"
                value={form.data.email}
                onChange={(e) => form.setData('email', e.target.value)}
                onBlur={() => form.validate('email')}
            />
            {form.invalid('email') && <div>{form.errors.email}</div>}

            <button>Create User</button>
        </form>
    );
};
```

Now, as the form is filled by the user, Precognition will provide live validation output powered by the validation rules in the route's form request. When the form's inputs are changed, a debounced "precognitive" validation request will be sent to your Laravel application. You may configure the debounce timeout by calling the form's `setValidationTimeout` function:

```js
form.setValidationTimeout(3000);
```

When a validation request is in-flight, the form's `validating` property will be `true`:

```jsx
{form.validating && <div>Validating...</div>}
```

Any validation errors returned during a validation request or a form submission will automatically populate the form's `errors` object:

```jsx
{form.invalid('email') && <div>{form.errors.email}</div>}
```

You can determine if the form has any errors using the form's `hasErrors` property:

```jsx
{form.hasErrors && <div><!-- ... --></div>}
```

You may also determine if an input has passed or failed validation by passing the input's name to the form's `valid` and `invalid` functions, respectively:

```jsx
{form.valid('email') && <span>✅</span>}

{form.invalid('email') && <span>❌</span>}
```

> **Warning**
> A form input will only appear as valid or invalid once it has changed and a validation response has been received.

    e.preventDefault();

    form.submit()
        .then(response => {
            form.reset();

            alert('User created.');
        })
        .catch(error => {
            alert('An error occurred.');
        });
};
```

        onSuccess: () => form.reset(),
    });
};
```

<a name="customizing-validation-rules"></a>
## Customizing Validation Rules

It is possible to customize the validation rules executed during a precognitive request by using the request's `isPrecognitive` method.

For example, on a user creation form, we may want to validate that a password is "uncompromised" only on the final form submission. For precognitive validation requests, we will simply validate that the password is required and has a minimum of 8 characters. Using the `isPrecognitive` method, we can customize the rules defined by our form request:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Requests;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;
use Illuminate\Validation\Rules\Password;

class StoreUserRequest extends FormRequest
{
    /**
     * Get the validation rules that apply to the request.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    protected function rules()
    {
        return [
            'password' => [
                'required',
                $this->isPrecognitive()
                    ? Password::min(8)
                    : Password::min(8)->uncompromised(),
            ],
            // ...
        ];
    }
}
```

<a name="managing-side-effects"></a>
## Managing Side-Effects

When adding the `HandlePrecognitiveRequests` middleware to a route, you should consider if there are any side-effects in _other_ middleware that should be skipped during a precognitive request.

For example, you may have a middleware that increments the total number of "interactions" each user has with your application, but you may not want precognitive requests to be counted as an interaction. To accomplish this, we may check the request's `isPrecognitive` method before incrementing the interaction count:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use App\Facades\Interaction;
use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class InteractionMiddleware
{
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     */
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): mixed
    {
        if (! $request->isPrecognitive()) {
            Interaction::incrementFor($request->user());
        }

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```
